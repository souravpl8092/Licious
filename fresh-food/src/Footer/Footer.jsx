          <b>We will sell only the meat that we would eat ourselves.</b>
          <br />
          <br />
          At Licious, we’re big meat-lovers. And by big, we mean huge. So when
          it comes to the meat we put on your plate, we’re extremely picky.
          Every single product is handpicked by a team with years of experience.
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>If it’s not fresh, we won’t sell it</b>
          <br />
          <br />
          For meat to stay fresh and retain its natural juices, it needs to be
          stored at a temperature between 0° and 5°C. We maintain this
          temperature from the time we procure the product to cleaning, cutting
          and storing it, until it leaves for delivery. And even when it’s out
          for delivery, we keep it chilled right up to your doorstep.Did we
          mention that we’re obsessed?
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>We will charge only for what you buy</b>
          <br />
          <br />
          Doesn’t everyone do this? Not really. Most other places first weigh
          the meat, then cut up the pieces, and throw out the parts which aren’t
          fit to eat, such as offal, gizzard, wingtips, etc. But you still pay
          based on the original weight even though what you finally get is 10%
          to 30% less
